<!--
   The action_attributes parameter entity is a convenient representation
   of the common attributes between an action and an action-list.

   template - a reference to a previously defined action. 
           
   type - if the value is "single" then the action represents a command
          action. If the value is "toggle" then the action is a multi-state
          action which may be selected or unselected. This value is
          "single" by default.
    
   name - the label for the action. Will be used as a localization key.
   			If no localization value could be found for a key, the name
   			string will be used in its raw form.

   mnemonic - the mnemonic to use for the action. Should be a single character.

   icon - the relative path to an image in the classpath that represents
            a small icon.
            
   sicon - the relative path to an image in the classpath that represents
            a small icon used as selected icon in toggle actions.

   licon - the relative path to an image in the classpath that represents a large icon.
   
   slicon - the relative path to an image in the classpath that represents a large icon
   			used as selected icon in toggle actions.
   

   desc - a short description of the action. Used for localization with the same
   			rules as the name attribute.
   			
   virtual - marks an action definition to serve as a template. Templates cannot be 
   			instantiated as actions directly but rather actions can be derived from
   			them. This way an application can define templates with attributes for
   			commonly used actions like 'copy', 'cut' and so on and then derive
   			specialized actions for different usages like 'copyEditorContent' without
   			the need to redefine all attributes for each derived action.
   			
   command - a string passed as action command to events created by the action. Can
   			be used to distinguish between multiple actions handled by the same
   			callback method.
   			
   help - boolean flag to signal whether or not the action should be registered for
   			displaying extended help information. If set to 'true' the action will
   			be registered using its 'id' attribute.
    
   accel - a string that represents the keyboard accelerator to invoke
           the action. The string should be formatted according to the syntax
           outlined in the javadoc for the static method:

                     javax.swing.KeyStroke#getKeyStroke(String)

           For example, the string "control S" represents the Control-S key.

<!ELEMENT actions (action | action-list | action-set)*>

<!-- 
    An action-set is an ordered collection of actions
    and grouping informations. 
-->

<!ELEMENT action-set (action | group)*>
<!ATTLIST action-set id ID #REQUIRED>

<!-- 
    The action element represents the properties of a javax.swing.Action. 
    This element can be a placeholder for an action within an action-set
    or action-list.
    
    id - a unique id for the action.

    The idref attribute should be used instead of the id attribute if an action 
    refers to a previous action definition. An action with both an id and 
    idref is undefined.

    See the desciption for the action_attributes entity for a detailed
    description of the rest of the attributes.

<!--
    The action-list is used to define lists and trees of actions.
    These can map to toolbars, menus and popups. Note that the list
    itself might define another action as well. This action is typically
    used to 'activate' the component constructed from the list information.

    See the desciption for the action_attributes entity for a detailed
    description of the rest of the attributes.

<!ELEMENT action-list (item | action | group | action-set | action-list | separator | empty)*>

<!--
    The item elements describes a single entry in an action-list
    
    The 'condition' attribute allows to filter which parts of an action-list
    should actually be instantiated on the GUI side based on global settings
    or properties provided to the current building task.
    The general format of this attribute is '[<namespace>:]<value>' with
    <namespace> being one of the following:
    	
    	global		Uses a fixed set of properties depending on the current app
    	
    
    Condition attribute format and its handling:
    
    global:<xxx>	
    
    Type attribute format and its handling:
    
    action:			Id used to resolve actual action instance to be
    				placed at the component
    action-list:	Id used to resolve an action-list that will be
    				inserted. The way this "insertion" is done depends
    				on the component being created. A menu will typically
    				be layed out hierarchically whereas a tool-bar will 
    				have nested action-lists "inlined".
    action-set:		Id to resolve a collection of actions to be inserted
    label:			String or localization key that is used on a JLabel
    custom:			Value treated as placeholder that is passed to the
    				'properties' map to fetch the object to be inserted.
    				This replacement object can be of the following types:
    				String - Displayed via JLabel
    				Action - Inserted at position of 'custom' element
    				ActionSet - Inserted at position of 'custom' element
    				ActionList - Inserted at position of 'custom' element
    				Component - Added to the container being populated
    				If the replacement object is an array its elements will 
    				be iterated and handled one by one according to the above
    				scheme. Note that is not possible to embed additional
    				arrays within the single replacement array.
    separator:		Call to the containers 'addSeparator()' method. Some
    				containers allow for the 'size' of the separator to be
    				specified. For such a container the 'value' attribute is
    				being interpreted as either a numerical width or one of
    				'small', 'medium', 'wide' with an implementation
    				specific mapping to actual separator width values.
    empty:			Places an empty placeholder at the current position (using 'value' as width).
    glue:			Inserts a 'glue' component, i.e. a component that expands
    				automatically to consume free space. This item type is not
    				supported by all action components. Usually only tool-bar
    				components make use of this.

    Generates a group of actions with a mutually exclusive selection state.
    Typically components generated for those actions are JToggleButton or

    their type attribute set to 'toggle'.
